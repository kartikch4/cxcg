Chest X-Ray Caption Generation


The project introduces a new Chest X-ray Caption Generation System that uses deep learning to 
provide contextually rich captions for chest X-ray images. The system uses Convolutional Neural 
Networks for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks for sequential caption generation. It 
is trained on a diverse dataset and uses transfer learning to adapt to anatomical variations and 
pathological conditions. The system's adaptability and performance make it a valuable tool for 
radiologists, clinicians, and medical practitioners in chest X-ray interpretation.
